<h1>Develop an android application to display id, name and address of 5 students using ListView</h1>
<h2>ListView</h2>
To develop an Android application that displays the image, name, and address of 5 students using a ListView, we'll need to:

Create a custom layout for each list item that includes an ImageView, TextView for the name, and another TextView for the address.
Create a custom adapter to bind the data (student images, names, and addresses) to the ListView.
Display the list in an Activity using the custom adapter.
